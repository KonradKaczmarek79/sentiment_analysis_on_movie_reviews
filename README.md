# sentiment_analysis_on_movie_reviews
final project - "Data Science PRO" Bootcamp in Kodołamacz/Sages (https://www.kodolamacz.pl/)

## Introduction
The aim of this project is to compare different approaches to working with text data in the case of sentiment analysis topic. In the following steps, various actions were carried out on the base texts regarding movie reviews, to bring this text data (documents) to a form from which machine learning algorithms can extract information about the sentiment groups of these documents.

## Dataset
**Large Movie Review Dataset** (https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/)

The dataset contains 50,000 movie reviews for binary sentiment classification (25,000 for training and 25,000 for testing). The reviews were taken from the IMDB portal and the file names contain info about the movie's numeric rating (stars awarded by the reviewer). As we can read in the note associated with the dataset the content of these reviews is “highly polar” – and it looks that the negative reviews have a rating between 0 and 4 and the positive reviews are rated from 7 to 10.

## Requirements and libraries’ versions
- all requirements (additional installs needed to run the coda) are contained in the file: `requirements.txt`
- all versions of modules, libraries, and things like that are listed in jupyter notebook: `suppprted_modules/proj_info.ipynb`
